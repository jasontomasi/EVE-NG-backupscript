# EVE-NG backupscript

This is a backup script written in linux bash for use with the EVE-NG virtual environment (https://www.eve-ng.net), to backup your EVE-NG labs and device configs, without repeatedly copying (and duplicating) the large router/switch/UC device firmware.

### Configuring the script
It contains two variables which you should change to suit your environment:

#### "EVEBACKUPDIR"
This sets the filepath for the backups to be written to

#### "EVEBACKUPDATE"
This sets the date format which is used to generate the backup filenames
